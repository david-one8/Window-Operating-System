# 🪟 Windows Operating System - Your Browser's New Best Friend! 🚀

> *"Why install Windows when you can just open a browser tab?"* �

Welcome to the most ambitious web project since someone decided to recreate Doom in a calculator! This isn't just another OS simulation - it's a **full-blown Windows 11 experience** that runs faster than your actual Windows (probably). 

Built with nothing but **pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** - no frameworks, no dependencies, just good old-fashioned web magic! ✨

🎭 **Plot Twist:** Your browser just became a complete operating system!
